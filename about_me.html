        <h3>A Recent Trip</h3>
        <p>I took a trip to Italy this May. I spent time in Rome, the Tuscan countryside, Florence, and Venice. It was an eventful trip for many reasons - the biggest reason being that I got engaged to my wonderful fiance Olivia.</p>

        <h3>My Favorite Restaurant</h3>

        <img src='images/tacos.jpg' align="left" width="400">
        <p>Tacos are my favorite food. I don't have a favorite way to make them, but that is what makes them so great. There are so many different combinations and ways to prepare them, each time is a new experience.</p>
